# which is the parent of the repository, so every secret was written to
# <parent>/prometheus/alertmanager-secrets -- a directory mkdir -p invented outside
# the repository, where the Compose bind mount cannot see it and no .gitignore
# covers it. It then tried to "apply" configuration with `docker cp` into
# alertmanager.yml and `sed -i` on prometheus.yml, both of which are read-only
# bind mounts, so it aborted on a read-only filesystem after writing the caller's
# SMTP password to the wrong place. It also printed the wrong Prometheus port.
#
# Nothing needs copying into a container here: both files are bind-mounted from
# the repository and take effect on restart.

Usage: setup-notification-channels.sh [--test] [--help]

Writes notification credentials from the environment into
prometheus/alertmanager-secrets/ (mode 0600), restarts Alertmanager, and verifies
that it loaded the configuration.

  --test   After configuring, post a synthetic critical alert and report whether
           each receiver actually accepted it. This is the only step that proves
           delivery works: `amtool check-config` succeeds even when every secret
           file is missing, because *_file options are not existence-checked.

Environment:
  SMTP_USERNAME          SMTP auth username (config hardcodes "alertmanager")
  SMTP_PASSWORD          SMTP auth password
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL      Slack incoming webhook URL
  PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY  PagerDuty integration routing key

Existing secret files are retained when the matching variable is unset, so the
script can be re-run to add one channel at a time.
