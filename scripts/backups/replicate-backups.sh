# Off-site Backup Replication
#
# Replicates this project's backups to a remote host, S3 and/or Backblaze B2.
#
# Two problems with the scripts this replaces, both of which hid a real issue:
#
# 1. They reported success when they had done nothing. replicate-to-s3.sh printed
#    "S3 replication not configured" and then, unconditionally, "S3 replication
#    completed", and logged success via logger. The health check that consumed
#    these logs only looked for the string "FAILED", so replication appeared
#    healthy for as long as nobody read the detail lines.
#
# 2. They synced all of /backups wholesale. That directory is shared: it also
#    holds another project's volumes, copied in by an older script, and a 49GB
#    system-image directory. So completing the credentials -- the obvious next
#    step -- would have shipped someone else's database to three external
#    providers, with `b2 sync --delete` mirroring deletions back. This script
#    replicates an explicit manifest of this project's own globs, so no other
#    project's data is reachable from here.

Usage: replicate-backups.sh [--dry-run] [target...]

Targets: remote, s3, b2. With no target, every configured one is attempted.

Configuration is read from $BACKUP_CONFIG (default
/home/deon/.secrets/backup-config.env). Nothing is interpolated into a command
line from an unset variable, and a target whose configuration is incomplete is
reported as NOT CONFIGURED and skipped -- never as completed.

Exits non-zero if any attempted target failed. A target that is not configured is
not a failure, but it is reported, so "nothing left the host" is never mistaken
for "everything was replicated".
