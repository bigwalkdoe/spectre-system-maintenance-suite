# Backup Health Check
#
# Verifies that backups exist, are non-empty, are readable archives, and are
# recent. Exits non-zero listing everything wrong.
#
# The check this replaces only grepped a replication log for the string "FAILED".
# That is not a health check. It passed continuously through 81 empty archives:
# the S3 replication script prints "replication completed" unconditionally after
# reporting missing credentials, so there was never a "FAILED" to find, and a
# log line cannot tell you whether a 45-byte file is a backup. This inspects the
# artifacts themselves.

# Is this file a real backup rather than a valid archive of nothing?
#
# `gzip -t` and `tar -tzf` both succeed on an archive of an empty directory, so
# "is it a valid archive" is not the question. The question is whether it has the
# structure of a backup of the thing it claims to be:
#   .sql.gz  -- a real pg_dump carries the "PostgreSQL database dump" header. A
#               failed dump is empty or an error string, and gzips to ~50 bytes.
#   .tar.gz  -- must list at least one member.
#   .rdb     -- must start with the REDIS magic. An empty cache is legitimately
#               tiny but is still a real RDB.
#
# Known limit: a tarball of an empty directory lists "." and therefore passes.
# For a volume backup, "valid archive with no data" is indistinguishable from a
# legitimately empty volume, and guessing a size threshold produces false
# failures on real small backups. Volume coverage is therefore established by the
# success marker and recency above, not by the contents of the tarball.
